# 🏗️ PyStruct Analyzer

PyStruct Analyzer is a powerful Python tool designed to analyze and visualize the structure of Python projects. It helps developers quickly understand complex project structures, facilitating efficient code review and documentation processes.

## 🎯 Project Purpose and Significance

As modern software development projects grow in scale and complexity, understanding and managing codebases becomes increasingly challenging. PyStruct Analyzer addresses this issue with the following objectives:

1. 🌳 Project Structure Visualization: Provides a clear overview of complex directory structures.
2. 🤖 Automated Code Analysis: Extracts and displays functions, classes, and methods automatically.
3. 🧠 Enhanced Code Comprehension: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT model to provide brief explanations for each code element.
4. 📚 Documentation Support: Assists in documentation tasks, such as README file generation.

With this tool, developers can adapt to new projects more quickly and gain a better understanding of existing project structures.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 Recursively scans directories for Python files
- 🙈 Ignores specified folders (e.g., `__pycache__`)
- 📊 Extracts and displays functions, classes, and methods from Python files
- 💡 Generates brief explanations for each function, class, and method using OpenAI's GPT model

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pystruct-analyzer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install openai python-dotenv
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Modify the `main.py` file to specify the directory you want to analyze:

   ```python
   directory = "path/to/your/directory"
   ignore_folders = {"__pycache__", "other_folder_to_ignore"}
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The script will output the directory structure, including files and their contents (functions, classes, and methods) with brief explanations.

## 📝 Usage Example

Here's an example of the output you might see when using PyStruct Analyzer:

```bash
src/
    pystruct_analyzer/
        __init__.py
        structure.py
            Class: DirectoryStructure - Analyzes directory structure and extracts Python file contents.
            Method: __init__() - Initializes the DirectoryStructure class.
            Method: list_py_files() - Lists all Python files in the directory.
            Method: extract_definitions() - Extracts function and class definitions using AST.
            Method: parse_file_structure() - Parses the structure of a Python file.
        printer.py
            Class: DirectoryPrinter - Prints the analyzed directory structure.
            Method: __init__() - Initializes the DirectoryPrinter class.
            Method: print_structure() - Outputs the directory structure to the console.
        explainer.py
            Class: SourceCodeExplainer - Uses OpenAI GPT to explain code snippets.
            Method: __init__() - Initializes the SourceCodeExplainer class.
            Method: explain() - Generates an explanation for the given source code.
main.py
    Function: main() - Entry point of the program, executes directory analysis.
```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point of the application
- `src/pystruct_analyzer/`:
  - `__init__.py`: Package initialization
  - `structure.py`: Contains `DirectoryStructure` class for analyzing directory structure
  - `printer.py`: Contains `DirectoryPrinter` class for displaying the analyzed structure
  - `explainer.py`: Contains `SourceCodeExplainer` class for generating brief explanations using OpenAI's GPT model

## 🔧 Customization

- To modify the OpenAI model used for explanations, update the `model` attribute in the `SourceCodeExplainer` class in `explainer.py`.
- Adjust the `max_tokens` attribute in `SourceCodeExplainer` to control the length of explanations.
- To ignore additional folders, add folder names to the `ignore_folders` set in `main.py`.

## ⚠️ Cautions and Limitations

1. 💸 OpenAI API Usage: This project uses OpenAI's GPT model. Be mindful of API usage and associated costs.
2. 🐢 Large Projects: Analysis time may increase significantly for very large projects.
3. 🎭 Explanation Accuracy: Explanations generated by the GPT model may not always be 100% accurate and should be reviewed.
4. 🔒 Privacy Considerations: Exercise caution when analyzing sensitive code, as information is sent to the OpenAI API.

## 🔮 Future Plans and Improvements

1. 🌐 Web Interface Development: Visually represent analysis results in a web browser.
2. 📊 Code Quality Analysis: Automatically detect complexity, code duplication, etc.
3. 🌍 Multi-language Support: Extend functionality to JavaScript, Java, and other languages.
4. 🔄 Version Control Integration: Analyze code changes using Git history.
5. ⚡ Performance Optimization: Improve analysis speed for large-scale projects.

We hope PyStruct Analyzer helps developers understand project structures more easily and manage code more efficiently. Feedback and contributions are always welcome! 🙌
